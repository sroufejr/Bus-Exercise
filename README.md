# Bus-Exercise
The goal of this exercise was to take advantage of MapBox API and JSON data of Boston bus routes to track the bus stops between MIT and Harvard.

# Installation
In order to view this demonstration, you will need to "Fork" a copy of this repository you your GitHub. Once you have done that you can "Clone" a copy of the repository to your local computer. When you have the files locally, you can open the index.html and begin using the program.

# How to Use
To view this exercise you will want to obtain an "Access Token" from www.mapbox.com.  First you will want to open to JavaScript file and paste your access token on the appropriate line of code (mapboxgl.accessToken = ").  Once your token is inputed and the file is saved you can open the index.html file.  There you will see the map and a button below it.  Clicking the button will start an animation in which the marker will gradually move along each of the bus stops between MIT and Harvard.

# Road Map
My future plans for this project is to make it into a fully functional bus tracking map.  I want to be able to display at least of few of the local bus routes as they progress in real time.
